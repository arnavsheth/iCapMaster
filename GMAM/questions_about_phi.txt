- What is the difference between \phi and \tilde{\phi}? 

\tilde{\phi} is restricted and \phi is not.

R matrix is a way to systematically quantify the restrictions. 

Delta t restrictions on P. As a result, \tilde{\phi} has length P + Delta t. Tilde Phi is fully determined from the Phi's that are generated by the model.

Phi is unrestricted and has length P.

Two major restrictions: 
(1) Traditional in the sense that the sum of the coefficients has to add up to Delta t. First P terms are the same as \phi and the remaining Delta t are restricted.
(2) Does not affect monthly assets. First, second, third month of each quarter are weighted equally.

- The last column of phi is \tilde{phi}. What does that mean?

See above. Tilde Phi is (1 - the sum of the Phi's).

Reasoning is that "industry does it this way" -- see Ang paper (not sure which one).

Motivation: stale NAVs and measurement error.

- How is \epsilon^y_t generated?

These are the error terms on the y.
x's also have errors. They are notated differently.

- Is it a "moving average" in the econometric sense? That is, a weighted sum of white noise terms?

Equivalent to a moving average to the first and second moments. See Section 3.5. Wold Decomposition Theorem. 

Error terms don't mean revert. The measurement error is the difference in NAVs from the generated returns and the actual reported returns.

Measurement error processes are moving average processes at the core.

- I'm still a little confused as to what P is. If \Delta t = 3 (12 divided by 4), then we want that if s = 2 (i.e., second quarter), t should equal 6 or 7? And in the latter case, P = 1?

P is a multiple of 3 (if talking in terms of quarterly).

t = 6 when P = 3, s = 1 (first quarter) and Delta t = 3. 
t = 9 when P = 3, s = 2 (first quarter) and Delta t = 3. 

P = 0 when both returns are monthly and match up exactly.

Phi would not be estimated in this case because it is of length P. 

ADDENDUM: 9/20
-There is zero autocorrelation in the x values as a consequence of the desmoothing other than the autocorrelation between factor returns. 

ADDENDUM (Aniket): 9/27
-Smoothing is done on x, which are generated from F\beta + r + epsilon
-Getting y from x is the smoothing

-Applying the moving-average is smoothing
-Model estimates x and we only smooth it 

-Phi + Tilde-Phi = 1 for monthly, and = 3 for quarterly
-Tilde Phi is there only so that the terms sum to 1 (or 3)
-This ensures that the quarterly returns are roughly 3x monthly

-P is always equal to 6

ADDENDUM (Aniket): 11/15
-There are at most three terms in the smoothing process RHS.
