	abstract = {We introduce a methodology to estimate the historical time series of returns to investment in private equity. The approach requires only an unbalanced panel of cash contributions and distributions accruing to limited partners, and is robust to sparse data. We decompose private equity returns into a component due to traded factors and a time-varying private equity premium. We find strong cyclicality in the premium component that differs according to fund type. The time-series estimates allow us to directly test theories about private equity cyclicality, and we find evidence in favor of the Kaplan and Str{\"o}mberg (2009) hypothesis that capital market segmentation helps to determine the private equity premium.},

	abstract = {A conditional one-factor model can account for the spread in the average returns of portfolios sorted by book-to-market ratios over the long run from 1926 to 2001. In contrast, earlier studies document strong evidence of a book-to-market effect using OLS regressions over post-1963 data. However, the betas of portfolios sorted by book-to-market ratios vary over time and in the presence of time-varying factor loadings, OLS inference produces inconsistent estimates of conditional alphas and betas. We show that under a conditional CAPM with time-varying betas, predictable market risk premia, and stochastic systematic volatility, there is little evidence that the conditional alpha for a book-to-market trading strategy is different from zero. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the performance and capital inflows of private equity partnerships. Average fund returns (net of fees) approximately equal the S&P 500 although substantial heterogeneity across funds exists. Returns persist strongly across subsequent funds of a partnership. Better performing partnerships are more likely to raise follow-on funds and larger funds. This relationship is concave, so top performing partnerships grow proportionally less than average performers. At the industry level, market entry and fund performance are procyclical; however, established funds are less sensitive to cycles than new entrants. Several of these results differ markedly from those for mutual funds.},

Buyout funds have outperformed the S&P 500 net of fees on average by approximately 20\% over the life of the fund. Venture capital funds raised in the 1990s outperformed the S&P 500, whereas those raised in the 2000s underperformed. The results are consistent across a number of data sets and papers. Before the 2000s, buyout and venture capital fund performance showed strong evidence of persistence.

   abstract = {We present a novel continuous-time approach to modeling the typical cash flow dynamics of private equity funds. Our model consists of two independent components. First is a mean-reverting square-root process is applied to model the rate at which capital is drawn over time. Second are capital distributions which are assumed to follow an arithmetic Brownian motion with a time-dependent drift component that incorporates the typical time-pattern of the repayments of private equity funds. Our empirical analysis shows that the model can easily be calibrated to real world fund data by the method of conditional least squares (CLS) and nicely fits historical data. We use a data set of mature European private equity funds as provided by Thomson Venture Economics (TVE). Our model explains up to 99.6 percent of the variation in average cumulated net fund cash flows and provides a good approximation of the empirical distribution of private equity fund cash flows over a typical fund's lifetime. Overall, the empirical results indicate that our model is of economic relevance in an effort to accurately model the cash flows dynamics of private equity funds.},

I discuss data and econometric issues for fund-level, deal-level, and publicly traded partnerships data. Risk-adjusted return estimates vary substantially by method, time period, and data source. The weight of evidence suggests that, relative to a similarly risky investment in the stock market, the average venture capital (VC) fund earned positive risk-adjusted returns before the turn of the millennium, but net-of-fee returns have been zero or even negative since. Average leveraged buyout (BO) investments have generally earned positive risk-adjusted returns both before and after fees, compared with a levered stock portfolio. Based on an expanded set of risk factors from the literature, VC resembles a small-growth investment, while BO loads mostly on value. I also discuss the empirical evidence on liquidity and idiosyncratic volatility risks.},

@article{Karatas2021,
   abstract = {Institutional investors have been increasing the allocation of the illiquid alternative assets such as private equity funds in their portfolios, yet there exists a very limited literature on cash flow forecasting of illiquid alternative assets. The net cash flow of private equity funds typically follow a J-curve pattern, however the timing and the size of the contributions and distributions depend on the investment opportunities. In this paper, we develop a benchmark model and present two novel approaches (direct vs. indirect) to predict the cash flows of private equity funds. We introduce a sliding window approach to apply on our cash flow data because different vintage year funds contain different lengths of cash flow information. We then pass the data to an LSTM/ GRU model to predict the future cash flows either directly or indirectly (based on the benchmark model). We further integrate macroeconomic indicators into our data, which allows us to consider the impact of market environment on cash flows and to apply stress testing. Our results indicate that the direct model is easier to implement compared to the benchmark model and the indirect model, but still the predicted cash flows align better with the actual cash flows. We also show that macroeconomic variables improve the performance of the direct model whereas the impact is not obvious on the indirect model.},

@report{Cochrane2004,
   abstract = {This paper measures the mean, standard deviation, alpha and beta of venture capital investments , using a maximum likelihood estimate that corrects for selection bias. We can only measure a return when a firm goes public, is acquired, or gets a new financing round. These events are more likely when the firm has achieved a good return, so estimates that do not correct for selection bias are optimistic. The bias-corrected estimate neatly accounts for log returns. It reduces the estimate of mean log return from 108\% to 15\%, and of the log market model intercept from 92\% to-7\%. However, log returns are very volatile, with an 89\% standard deviation. Therefore, arithmetic average returns and intercepts are much higher than geometric averages. The selection bias correction dramatically attenuates but does not eliminate high arithmetic average returns: it reduces the mean arithmetic return from 698\% to 59\%, and it reduces the arithmetic alpha from 462\% to 32\%. I check the robustness of the estimates in a variety of ways. The estimates reproduce and are driven by clear stylized facts in the data, in particular the pattern of returns and exits as a function of project age. They are confirmed in subsamples and across industries, and they are robust to several ways of handling measurement errors. I find little difference between estimates that emphasize round-to-round returns and estimates based on round-to-IPO returns, where we might see an illiquidity premium lifted. I also find that the smallest Nasdaq stocks have similar large means, volatilities, and arithmetic alphas in this time period, confirming that even the puzzles are not special to venture capital.},

   abstract = {The basic univariate stochastic volatility model specifies that conditional volatility follows a log-normal auto-regressive model with innovations assumed to be independent of the innovations in the conditional mean equation. Since the introduction of practical methods for inference in the basic volatility model (JPR (1994)), it has been observed that the basic model is too restrictive for many financial series. We extend the basic SVOL to allow for a so-called "leverage effect" via correlation between the volatility and mean innovations, and for fat-tails in the mean equation innovation. A Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed for the extended volatility model. Thus far, likelihood-based inference for the correlated SVOL model has not appeared in the literature. We develop Bayes Factors to assess the importance of the leverage and fat-tail extensions. Sampling experiments reveal little loss in precision from adding the model extensions but a large loss from using the basic model in the presence of mis-specification. There is overwhelming evidence of a leverage effect for weekly and daily equity indices. The evidence in favor of fat-tails is very strong for daily exchange rate and equity indices, but less so for weekly data. We also find that volatility estimates from the extended model are markedly different from those produced by the basic SVOL. JEL Classification: C1, C11, C15, G1},
