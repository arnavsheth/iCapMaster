-I have in my notes that for gamma_k > 0.5, then beta is likely to be selected. However, I also have in my notes that gamma_k is either zero or one -- some kind of factor indicator. What is gamma_k? What is its purpose in the larger model? And is it zero, one, or something inbetween?

Creates the spike and slab effect. Regularization for the factor model. Something that induces sparsity -- the difference between OLS and LASSO. Gamma_k is 0/1 and it's the expectation of Gamma_k that's 0.5.

Spike and slab is like Bayesian parsimony. Did a ton of reading on this. Want to drive the most value to clients with respect to being able to analyze risk. Don't want to waste their time with a factor that has a low likelihood of being a driver of those PE returns. Business standpoint. It's akin to saying that there are primary risk factors for each PE fund. 

Expect that S&P500 would have material exposure to the MSCI World (market factor in our factor set). You would expect economic significance of a factor. Spike-slab assigns a point-mass probability to zero. It assigns a high-prob, low-var, to various factors.

d_k is either 0 or 1. The v^2 is a precision parameter that

-George and McCulloch - both papers.

-Regarding nu:
	-You mention Wand et all 2011 but that is on Variational Bayes. Is this correct?
	-Which t-distribution are you talking about?
	
Updating nu is not a conjugate prior. It's a nonstandard mixture distribution for the updating. Metropolis Hastings is used to sample. Look at page 31 of the model notes.
