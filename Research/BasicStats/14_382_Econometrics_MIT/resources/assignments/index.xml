      <description>Homework 1 Solve 3 out 6 problems from Lecture 1 (PDF). For empirical questions we encourage you to go beyond the analysis in the lectures to deepen your own understanding of the concepts we are covering and their implication for real economics research.
You can use any software you like. The link to data for empirical problems is available below. Write-ups should be concise and presented in the format of short sections that can be inserted into an empirical paper or research report.</description>

      <description>Solve one of problems 1, 2, or 3 from Lecture 2 (PDF) and one of problems 4 or 5 from Lecture 2. You can use any econometric/statistical software you like. The data sets are posted below. Please provide detailed write-ups: explain theoretical foundations of your analysis and provide step-by-step explanation for your empirical analysis. Think that you are writing an empirical portion of your paper and you are trying to communicate the results to your colleagues and referees.</description>

      <description>Solve one of the problems 1–4 and one of the problems 5–6 from Lecture 3 (PDF). You can use any econometric/statistical software you like. In Stata you can used &amp;ldquo;reg3&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;gmm&amp;rdquo; command to implement limited information and full information estimation. In R, please see the attached code for consultation. (Please do write your own code though). The data sets are posted below. Please provide theoretical foundations of your analysis and provide step-by-step explanation for your empirical analysis.</description>

      <description>Part A (Theory) (i) Solve one of questions 1–5 in Lecture 4 (PDF). (ii) Solve question 1 in Lecture 5.
Part B. (Empirics) (i) Solve question 6 from Lecture 4. (ii) Solve question 2 from Lecture 5 (PDF). You may consult the R code included (but do not copy it), it relies on the GMM package. If you are using Stata, there is a GMM command there with good documentation and there is also a bs command (no kidding) also called bstrap and bootstrap.</description>

      <description>Solve theoretical problems 1–2 and empirical problem 3 in Lecture 6 (PDF). Unlike in the previous homework, feel free to use the R code that is provided to you, but make sure to provide additional comments to the code explaining what each major block of the code is doing. Note that you can type (help(“glm”) to get help on the command glm, etc).

      <description>Solve problems 1 and 2 in Lecture 7 (PDF) and 1 in Lecture 8 (PDF). Problem 2 in L8 is optional and you earn a &amp;ldquo;++&amp;rdquo; for doing the problem. You are wellcome to use the R code provided (write comments in the code explaining what each block of the code is doing), except for question 1 in L8 you need to write your own code (which should be standard any way).</description>
