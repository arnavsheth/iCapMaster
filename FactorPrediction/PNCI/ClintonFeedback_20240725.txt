- keep first methodology pic, and last one; fill in the gaps with words (one slide)
- add point estimates to fund return distributions (mean and sd)
- pick one bad fund, put in appendix
- clip out appendix if slides are asked for
- let them know in the next steps slide that these results will be plugged into the optimization

- rerun OLS on entire dataset, include standard errors and factor projection point estimates
