email service desk and ask for:
	-alpha environment on aws
	-qa env
	-prod env

Tim will email Yang on the environment. And information on Postman.

Postman should be the priority.
	
What do I do with the two repos?

Clone these two repos on to my laptop.

aws-okta 
	-read the readme -- you can do it after you get aws access
	
appscripts
	-run the script Tim sent

Set up postman:
	-application that helps you hit / set up endpoints 
		- endpoint is a web url that connects to an underlying function
		- clicking on the url will do something
	-postman helps interaction with endpoints in a user friendly way
	

We have data services that have this data.
Postman helps with which id is associated with the asset class.

- Tim is involved with Kunpeng on mapping asset classes to indices
	- Why indices? Because ETFs have fees.
- Next steps:
	- I have to do the Postman stuff and clone the Gitlab repos

- Logic:
	- Start with building blocks ETFs
	- If not available use Envestnet Index
	- If not available then he uses his judgement
