WHAT IS A KALMAN FILTER?

SLIDE 1

There is confusion in the way they are commonly used across the two disciplines:
	- In engineering, parameters known, state variables to be estimated.
	- In economics, parameters to be estimated, state variables known.

WHY KALMAN FILTERS?

SLIDE 3

1. They embody the Markov property and boil down to a set of recursions. Thus amenable to situations where we have a lot of data.

2. Standard linear models likely to be thrown off course by unknown structural breaks and regime changes, resulting in biased parameter estimates and inaccurate forecasts.

For example, you could use rolling OLS to cope with structural breaks, but fitted values of Kalman filters react more quickly. 

3. The Kalman filter construction of the state vector is essentially via OLS. 


SLIDE 7

- In this setup, \eta_t is the element in the transition equation driving mu_t to change over time.
- If \sigma^2_\eta is zero or close to zero this implies that \mu_t is effectively constant and does not need to be allowed to vary over time.
	- In this situation, a constant drift model would probably be preferable.
	
SLIDE 8

- This model is more familiar. Also known as the STOCHASTIC SLOPE model.

- Time-varying parameter models are an extension of the fixed-parameter models. 
	- E.g., the effects of improving technology, improving efficiency,, reduced production costs, increased scarcity of resources, etc.
	- If fuel consumption is y, and engine size is x, the slope estimate ought to be positive, diminishing as engines become more fuel efficient.

SLIDE 10
- \beta is assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean b and variance P. 
	- Since no prior information is usually available, the convention is to set b to its expected value of 0, and P to an arbitrarily large number such as 1,000,000.
	- Logic is that \beta is assumed to be integrated of order one. Meaning, it requires one degree of differencing to be stationary. 
	- A non-stationary series usually exhibits an infinite variance.
	- The arbitrary nature of setting these values is considered a disadvantage of using Kalman filters.


- The recursive process is used to effectively choose the Kalman gain to effectively minimize \sigma_\eta^2.
