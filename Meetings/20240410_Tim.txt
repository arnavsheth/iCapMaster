CONVERSATION WITH TIM (April 10 2024)
- Talked about issues relating to implementation:
	- If we are going to have CMAs then we should have a check on how the CMAs perform before implementing them.
	- We should not be using prod time to check and experiment.
- Talked about a new idea for product development:
	- Increasing the level of quantitative analytics offering on Architect.
	- Suggested portfolio allocations for users
	- Suggested SIs for users based on advanced analytics (Sharpe, volatility, hedging, etc.)
