Evergreen Funds - how can we showcase the value of these funds? Also, how can we optimize portfolios with these funds?

- Use indices to promote and sell iCapital
- You need a good PR 
- First and foremost purpose is referential and what it refers to is important
- How do you create the name for an index that fits into roughly 12 characters
- Heavily regulated: FINRA and SEC

Four indices:
	1) PE funds on marketplace
	2) PE funds on marketplace that iCap distributes - full due diligence
	3) All HF on marketplace
	4) HF that iCap distributes - full due diligence
	
Funds that are available to accredited investors

- We have at least 20 funds in those categories
- Looking at credit and real estate (many of those are non-traditional fund structures)
	- Might be something I can help with

- Synthesis of what are characteristics of key indices used today?
	- Cambridge
	- Preqin
	- Pitchbook
	- Burgess (bought by MSCI)
	- HFR for hedge funds
	- Cliffwater
	- NCREIF
	
- Chart with how many constituents, net or gross of fees, how often rebalanced?

- Cambridge tried to market their indices with IHS Markit
- No experience in marketing indices
- Cambridge does not have any PMEs

- So what does iCapital have to add? Why do it at all?
	- None of them have the ability to show a non-institutional investor ("retail")
	- Only iCap has a broad enough view into alt funds to represent a decent benchmark of performance
	- Say there are 16K alt funds raising money globally
	- Marketplace as a small subset (~100 funds)

- Why create indices?
	- We have the representative funds for retail investors 
	- Retail does not have the knowledge about this
	- Retail have even less awareness 
	- Not aware that there are investments in that asset class that are available to them as an individual
	- We have an opportunity to create indices that represent to the individual investor a swath of investment opportunities that they are not aware of
	- Not all are available to everyone
	- Some are available to everyone, some to "accredited"

- What is the index?
	- We've agreed that 20 funds are a reasonable number for this
		- We = Lawrence, Kunal, Cheryl
		- Why 20? Data availability
		- Enter the index and leave the index
		- Reconstitute every 6 months
		- Funds will be added/substracted based on ground rules
		- Equal-weighted and will be anonymized

- Say we create the index 
	- What's the value if you can't identify what the underlying funds?
	- The value is you can still measure performance.
- Why should funds be anonymized?
	- Don't have the rights from GPs to use the data publicly.
	- Have rights to use the data privately.
	- Have the rights to use the data for back-office operations.
	- Have the rights to use the data in an aggregated and anonymized fashion.
	
- Because we sell the underlying investments. We are also the OS/backbone for the industry.
	- Take the LSE. They have a unit that does research. They have a unit that sells listings. 
	- Makes money off of ETFs. 
	- What they don't do is do everything under the same umbrella entity.
	- Can't affect the index return so that the other investments make more money.
	- Can't affect the objectivity of the research.
	- Regulators think of iCap as a broker/dealer and RIA.
	- Regulators don't think of iCap as a fintech companies.
	- iCap may head there but we are not there right now.
		- Index will be the first "information product".
		- Veronis and Vinay thought about this when they started.
		- 10 years later still not there.

- Telling me this because we are a highly regulated entity.
	- Not used to that as an academic. 
	- Regulators take the license away. Can find these companues on their websites.
	- Anyone more than three years will tell you that indices will be what makes iCap loses its license.
	- Regulators "brain will explode" if we create a "bad" index.
		- Ihor heads up GP relationship management.
		- He talks about performance to the GPs. 
	- Index building is an existential risk for iCap.
	
- Why is now the time?
	- GPs are freaking out because "milk and honey" since 2008 and companies stopped going public.
	- Majority of the opportunity happens in private markets.
	- Until now, individuals were not even aware they could invest in private markets.
	- Yahoo Finance will have an iCapital index.
		- To get there, we have to go through the full burden of measuring and mitigating the regulatory risk.
		- Once we create the methodology and ground rules we will have to outsource the management of the index.
			- Because of LIBOR.
			
- First question to ask: "Will it cause regulatory issues?"
	- General answer is yes.
	- Equal-weighted will cause the least regulatory issues.
	- Madeline will push back on everything ( in charge of compliance ).
	- High level of protection against individual investors.
	- Institutionally it is caveat emptor.
	
- What can Arnav do?
	- Task Force: 
			- Pat Callaghan
			- Shan Hasnat
			- One more - didn't get the name
		- Kunal Shroff (Head of Pvt Mkts), Joe Burns (Head of HF)
		- Nominated people to work with Cheryl on financial information products.
			- Indices; trends and insights (BDCs went down, outflows in this type of fund, inflows in this type of fund).
	- Joe and Kunal's team select the funds; do the due diligence.
	- Outsource operational due diligence and some other kinds of diligence by Castle Hall.
	- Do not sell a fund that Kunal's teams that have not diligenced.
	- Team also conduct research, thought leadership, attend conferences.
	- 30-40 funds picked by Kunal and Joe's teams. 
	- More are sold by GPs on Marketplace.
		- May or may not have diligenced.


- What are next steps?	
	- Get Clinton's approval.
	- Should meet Kunal and Joe.

- Smooth out revenue line. Subscription revenue is sticky.
	- Current revenue is basis point driven. When a structured product expires revenue dries up.
- Reduce dependency on various business lines.
- Increase diversification.

- CALPERS wants to invest in companies that have smooth revenues that are predictable.
	- Need to be more predictable to be a public company.
	- Case in point: S&P (also in the information space) pays out dividends every year since 1957.
