	-Based on this, how should we prioritize testing?
	-Is it asset class?
	-How long will it take to test?
	-What is the first phase?
	-What are the sources of risk to the timeline?
	
PHASE 1: Asset class level (what might cause problems here (i.e., what are the sources of risk?))
PHASE 2: Asset level (data will change, what are the sources of risk)

Thinking about things in phases. What are the risks associated with each phase?

- Why not project assets directly? Why do it via this two-step of projecting factor returns?
	- This requires another scheduled job.

- Biz dev has a better understanding of user needs. So we want their buy-in for the asset classes.
- No surprises for the asset classes. Everyone should be agreed on it.
	- It's a very subjective process so we want everyone internally to agree on it.
	
- What about Structured Investments?
