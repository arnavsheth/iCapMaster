Why is iCapital not in India?
SLIDE 1

The optimal portfolio is a theoretical construct that offers the  highest expected return for a given level of risk, or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return. It's the "best" portfolio you can have based on your risk-return preferences.

A stochastic discount factor is a bit more complex. It is also a theoretical construct. It's literally a discount factor that is stochastic or random -- it varies with different states.

So what this statement means is that the assets in the optimal portfolio are priced correctly when their expected returns discounted by the SDF, equal their current prices.

Their approach is a regularization of the left-hand side of the predictability problem - "which factors are predictable?" - rather than the right-hand side - "which variables are useful predictors?". Use only the book-to-market ratio of each portfolio as a measure to predict its returns.

They construct the portfolios as follows. 
	- Use the universe of CRSP and Compustat stocks and sort them into ten value-weighted portfolios for each of the fifty characteristics studied in Kozak et al. (2020). 
	- Portfolios include all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ firms; however, the breakpoints use only NYSE firms as in Fama and French (2016). 
	- Sample consists of monthly returns from January 1974 to December 2017.

The book-to-market ratio, bm, of a portfolio is defined as the sum of book equity relative to the total market capitalization of all firms in that portfolio. Equivalently, it is the market-capitalization weighted average of individual stocksâ€™ bm ratios.

SLIDE 5

Their internet appendix has details on the derivation of this formula and on how the five PCs fulfill this criterion.



They found a partner decided not to move ahead. Parked the potential opportunity for two main reasons:

(1) More attractive markets -- APAC and Middle East

(2) How do you go into the new market? Partner up, buy a local, go on your own
	- Done on their own in EMEA and APac 
	- Appropriate licenses, legal entity
	
Dealing with:
- Israel: just getting into 
- France:
- Japan: big committment
- Australia:

Touch base on Jan 30.

FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS: 
	- Do we have partners in other countries? 
	- What do we look for in a partner?

- Australia
- Maybe Chinese money.
- One person in Japan.

- No point in reaching out to individual funds -- just not worth it being listed on the platform.
	- Best to reach out to a bank that has some funds in their wealth management group and they need feeders for those funds because clients don't have large enough capital.
	
- If an Indian expat does not want to deal with bureaucracy or capital controls but wants to invest in India.
	- Feeder fund set up in the Caymans will allow them to funnel money through to India.
	- This is what they're doing in Israel.
