Questions on Kalman Filters:
- How is it an extension of ARMA?
- How does it differ from Markov models where you are estimating transition probabilities?

One potential issue:
- Trying to project several months (up to a year) into the future.

Efficacy test:
- How far outside the 95% confidence bounds is it?
