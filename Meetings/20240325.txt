Use R^2 instead of RMSE as a selection criterion.
	-Switch to leave-one-out.
	-Use out-of-sample. 

Lasso via LARS: it selects the RHS vars that adds the most explanatory power. Implemented for G2.

To assess whether asset classes are good with the indexes. Group R^2.

Say, we have 55 asset classes. We select 15. Run 55 regressions with the 15 on the right-hand-side. Drop the 15 on the RHS that match up with the 55 on the LHS (one by one, of course).

Updated 20240402:
	- Do the R^2 stuff on the asset classes. Not the factor projections. 
	- How do we select the 15?

COVARIANCE CALCULATION:

Take the 55 residual series, calculate variances, and then divide that by the sum variances of the original series. Multivariate R^2 ("percent variance explained").

Talk with Kunpeng about how to modify externally provided variance covariance matrix.

Let $\Sigma = L^T L$ -- so basically, Sigma is psd

What is the jacobian of Sigma-inverse ($Sigma^{-1}$)? Specifically, the determinant for it?
