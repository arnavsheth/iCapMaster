- Get indices related to the CMA asset classes and associated time series returns.
- Connect those with our 13 factors (economically).

- Generate the future returns from that relationship. Recognize that there will be lead-lag effect.

- Kalman Filter may not be the most appropriate if we can see the state variables in the form of time series.

- Read the factor timing paper. Keep things simple.

Another question:
- Suppose we have the expected returns and covariance of the assets going forward.
- ???
