- Biggest issue with implementation is having the right indexes.
	-Good stretch activity.

- Schedule a meeting with Tim, look at the indexes for CMAs and make sure they are appropriate for our purposes.

	- Quant: plugging in and making sure everything looks ok.
	- Offload the work as much as you can.
