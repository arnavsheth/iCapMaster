Hope you are having a good weekend. I looked at your self-review- I think we should work on your goals- this is my bad, I should have given you more guidance on these.
 
Given the long-run nature of research work and the inherent uncertainty, most, if not all, of the research goals tend to be much more general.

In the cases where a goal is specific, it should only pertain to items that are scheduled to be completed this year (preferably with a margin).
 
For example- here are mine. Note four goals is on the high end, 2-3 goals is fine.
 
Perform research to power portfolio analytics on joint platform: Perform and facilitate quantitative research in creating an economic and/statistical basis for features used on Project Rainbow portfolio analytics platform. Lead delivery of core GMAM 3 intellectual capital by end of Q3. Distribute and present research internally and externally to the benefit of iCapital internal and external stakeholders.

Build and develop a quantitative research group and manage quantitative research activity: Vet, select, ramp up, and mentor quant resources. Manage quant research projects and build stakeholder buy-in. Group's goals: product enhancement, applied research, and blue-sky innovation.

Create high quality original research that furthers understanding of finance and/ economics: Perform and facilitate high quality original quantitative research in finance and economics on topics relevant to ICN and its clients. Present and distribute research and align stakeholders around motivation, methodology, and conclusions.

Increase research impact: Advance understanding of finance, investments, and/or technology internally or externally through presentations, learning sessions, courses, mentorship, and/or learning media.
 
Please take another crack at these- we can discuss during this meeting.
 
Your review itself is fine for this year, though in the future I might organize it a bit more around the goals. Again, not a problem for this year though.
 
Best,
Clinton

MY NOTES (11/08/23):

Separate on topics. Not too many bullet points. 

1. Do good research.
2. Ensure that some of the good research is aligned with the business model.
3. Spread the research within and outside the firm. Impact. 
4. Grow and learn. Personal development.
