VARIANCE COVARIANCE OF FACTOR RETURNS

Sure, let's simplify the scenario to focus on just one asset and two factors. We'll use real-world data for the factors and calculate the systematic variance-covariance matrix between these factors.

Let's say we have the following data:

- Asset A: Returns = [5%, 3%, 2%, 4%, 6%]
- Factor 1 (Market Returns): Returns = [2%, 1.5%, 3%, 2.5%, 2.8%]
- Factor 2 (Interest Rates): Returns = [0.5%, 0.3%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%]

We'll calculate the systematic variance-covariance matrix between these two factors.

First, let's calculate the covariance matrix for the factors using their historical returns:

\[ \text{Factor Covariance Matrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.000775 & 0.00043 \\ 0.00043 & 0.000155 \end{bmatrix} \]

Next, we need to estimate the factor loadings for Asset A. Let's assume the following factor loadings based on our analysis:

\[ \text{Factor Loadings for Asset A} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.6 & 0.3 \\ 0.4 & 0.2 \end{bmatrix} \]

Now, we'll calculate the systematic variance-covariance matrix between the factors:

\[ \text{Systematic Variance-Covariance Matrix (Factors)} = \text{Factor Loadings} \times \text{Factor Covariance Matrix} \times \text{Factor Loadings}^T \]

\[ = \begin{bmatrix} 0.6 & 0.3 \\ 0.4 & 0.2 \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} 0.000775 & 0.00043 \\ 0.00043 & 0.000155 \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} 0.6 & 0.4 \\ 0.3 & 0.2 \end{bmatrix} \]

Performing the matrix multiplication, we get:

\[ \text{Systematic Variance-Covariance Matrix (Factors)} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.00047847 & 0.00027333 \\ 0.00027333 & 0.00015587 \end{bmatrix} \]

This matrix represents the systematic component of the variance-covariance matrix between Factor 1 (Market Returns) and Factor 2 (Interest Rates) based on the factor model and the factor loadings for Asset A.

I hope this example clarifies the calculation process. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. You are correct that we should consider the full residual covariance matrix instead of just point estimates for the specific risk. Let me provide a more accurate example.

Step 3: Specific Risk Estimation
Instead of using point estimates for the specific risk, we estimate the residual covariance matrix using the residuals from the factor regression. Let's assume we obtain the following residual covariance matrix:

         Stock A   Stock B   Stock C
Stock A  0.0050    0.0010    0.0015
Stock B  0.0010    0.0040    0.0008
Stock C  0.0015    0.0008    0.0060

Step 4: Covariance Matrix Projection
We project the covariance matrix for the stocks using the factor exposures, factor covariance matrix, and residual covariance matrix. The projected covariance matrix is calculated as follows:

Projected Covariance Matrix = Factor Exposures × Factor Covariance Matrix × Factor Exposures^T + Residual Covariance Matrix

Using the example values from the previous steps, we can calculate the projected covariance matrix:

         Stock A   Stock B   Stock C
Stock A  0.0266    0.0125    0.0178
Stock B  0.0125    0.0153    0.0112
Stock C  0.0178    0.0112    0.0249

The projected covariance matrix now incorporates the full residual covariance matrix instead of just point estimates for the specific risk.

Step 5: Covariance Matrix Projection with Means
If we also want to consider the means of the residuals (alphas) in the covariance matrix projection, we can add them to the diagonal of the residual covariance matrix. Let's assume the means of the residuals are as follows:

Stock A: 0.0010
Stock B: -0.0005
Stock C: 0.0008

We update the residual covariance matrix by adding the means to the diagonal:

         Stock A   Stock B   Stock C
Stock A  0.0060    0.0010    0.0015
Stock B  0.0010    0.0035    0.0008
Stock C  0.0015    0.0008    0.0068

Then, we recalculate the projected covariance matrix using the updated residual covariance matrix:

         Stock A   Stock B   Stock C
Stock A  0.0276    0.0125    0.0178
Stock B  0.0125    0.0148    0.0112
Stock C  0.0178    0.0112    0.0257

The projected covariance matrix now incorporates both the factor exposures and the means of the residuals.

I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. The residual covariance matrix should be used instead of point estimates for the specific risk, and the means of the residuals can be included in the covariance matrix projection if desired.
