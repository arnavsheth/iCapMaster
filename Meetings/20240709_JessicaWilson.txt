super helpful super friendly want to figure this out
want an integrated platform from icapital

icapital relationship manager at pnci: larry wasserman (head of due diligence, cfa, cfp)

nick bailey -- most engaged. they develop the pnci model portfolios. conservative-moderate-aggressive. 

- they are trying to attach a sleeve of alts to the model portfolios
- that's what icap is trying to sell them through our connection with envestnet

- optimization = "harmonization"

- they are creating the CMAs and they are putting the portfolios together
- recent conversation: nick bailey (senior member) asked how we derive SI and alts CMAs.
	- here's the methodology for factor projections


- stay at the 10,000-foot level
- non-PhD-level audience

- what is icap optimization going to suggest for PNCI CMAs?
- what if i add asset classes to traditional 60-40? how will the optimization get affected?

- we can upsell them to wanting to use our CMAs for their optimization
