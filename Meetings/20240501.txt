How do we create confidence estimates of the coefficients in the final OLS?

Options:
	(1) Block bootstrap (circular vs noncircular)
	(2) Parametric bootstrap under the null hypothesis
		- comparing against a simulation of the original series

- For client-provided CMAs, have them upload history and include it with our CMAs.

- For a one-factor model (for example), the model is inefficient, but we should use the residuals, and the cross-correlation.
	- When projecting covariance matrix. 

- For asset-level variance-covariance matrix, we can use the G3 factor loadings and multiply them with the long-run historical var-covar of the factors themselves.
	- we can also use some other var-covar matrix instead of the long-run historical
	- for example, the one from the PCA
