Aniket - 
	1. Standardize to compare projections. 

		Use the projected mean and standard deviation to create standardized value for all the returns for all the factors, monthly in 2024. 4 months of data. 13 x 4 = 52 data points. Of the 52 how many are bigger than 95%.

		Do that on 2024 data. No need for any additional code.

	2. Look at only the test scores for both methods instead of the difference between the two.
	
	3. Update LARS Lasso writeup.


Tim - 
	1. Why is Test routinely greater than Train? Check to see the value of the RMSE for each split.
		Kunpeng:
			- the test period is more recent, so that might be the issue.
		Tim:
			- distribution across the different folds has an extreme good number.
			- expanding window means more recent windows.


	2. When we use the expected returns from the external CMA providers, what asset classes will we be using? Our own, or the external providers?
		- Will we be generating our own CMAs? Is there a more systematic way to map the CMAs to our asset classes?
		- Take existing views, derive view on asset class (e.g., Fund of Funds, Pvt Real Asset). Or come up with a more systematic method of mapping asset classes to CMAs.
		
		ANSWER: asset classes and expected returns for those specific asset classes will be provided each time we run the code.
		
		- crude mapping and make sure everyone is ok with it.
		- given the CMA provider's expectations, can we construct new asset classes from what they've given us.
		
		- treat the asset class as an asset in G3. Use projected factor expectations, and coefficients from G3 to get an expected return on the asset.
		- if the asset classes from user match up with our asset classes, we can replace our asset class with their history.
		
		MAJOR ISSUE:
			- what if the client gives us a view on an asset class that we don't have, and we provide a view, what if our view conflicts with the client's view?
			- more specifically, what if the client does NOT give us a view on a particular asset class, and we provide a view. what if our view does not match up with their views on the asset classes for which the client does have views?
			- for example, if we have a view on pvt real assets, it should somehow relate to asset classes for which the client does have views.
		
		
	3. What exactly do we need to show to BizDev. What is the use-case for this?
		
		ANSWER: it is an input into the optimization as a future expected return. 
			- Showing other info for asset-level performance. Big compliance barriers there.
			

	- We know the model doesn't perform well on equity (Tim).

Aniket - 
	Resids from G3 added to resids from PCR for varcovar projections.


Yang - 
	Are the two resids above correlated?


For the follow up meeting, some rough plan for the var-covariance. 

TEAM MEETING: MAY 20 2024

Clinton: 
	- By doing PCR, we are biasing the results in terms of the bias-variance tradeoff.
	- By doing G3, we are biasing the results in the priors.
	
Aniket:
	- Model efficacy for the PCR, out of sample R^2 (same as for G2).
