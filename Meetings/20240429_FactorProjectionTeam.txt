Design discussion -
	What will be the specific outputs of the factor projection "module" and in what format
	Where will these outputs be stored and how
	What parts of these outputs will the optimizer "module" ingest and in what format
Work allocation and Timeline - 
	When will the RPoC be ready (Arnav)
	When will the PPoC be ready (Aniket)
	When is the final productionizing expected


ANIKET AND KUNPENG
- Factor returns are going to be used primarily for optimization.
- We will provide 10-year projections because the CMAs are 10-year projections.
- They will be updated every month as the data updates.
- Expected returns are going to be shown at the porfolio level to the user.
- Covariance matrix will be calculated at the factor level and at the asset level, in the same way.
	- Beta * Historical Varcovar * Beta^T
	- Will the resulting varcovar projection be well-conditioned?


YANG
- Is it necessary to update every month? 
	- Will the client be comfortable with this?
		- Client will only see portfolio returns and risk after the optimization.
		- They are not going to see the factor-projected returns and covariances.
	- Clients will run the optimization over and over again. If they see very different results in each month, this is a problem.
		- That will happen if the asset betas are changing dramatically.
		- We will have a good explanation for it.
	- How sensitive is the optimizer to these changes (in the G3 betas, in the factor projections, in the CMAs)?
		- It's possible.
