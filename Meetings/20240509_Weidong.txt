Spoke with Weidong about the indexing idea. Where I take the asset level projections and combine them to create some kind of forward-looking index.

- Follow up with Shan on what he's doing with the model portfolios, and whether an index will be able to help him in some fashion.
- Check with both Shan and Cheryl on where the indexing project is.

- Check up on evergeen funds. Apparently that was a thing in today's Product Town Hall. Weidong said there will be plenty of opportunities for quant analysis with these kinds of funds.
