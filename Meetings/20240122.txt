Factor Prediction

1. Reduce dimensions of the CMA factors.
2. Regress our 13 factors one by one (on the LHS) with the reduced PCs on the RHS.
3. Plug in expected returns from CMAs for getting next-period factor return.

Kunpeng and Clinton have created a PSD and a PD matrix from the CMAs.
First step is to make it PSD using an iterative algorithm from the CS literature.
Second step is to make it PD using a convex combination of Ledoit Wolf shrinkage matrix and the PSD matrix.
