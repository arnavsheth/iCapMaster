Meeting with Clinton (12/28/2023)
- Two things I need to do:
	1. What do we need to do about the paper?
	2. Factor projections.
	
- Need to manage the Cheryl situation carefully.
	- Set up a meeting with Clinton, Weidong, Cheryl, and me to check how we can best help her.
- Shan will also want to be involved.
	- Maybe want to offload some of the work to him.
	- Keep more of a check-and-verify role.
	- Cash flow composite versus IRRs.
	- CT has talked to Shan about this in the past.

- One ongoing project that is dormant that might heat up while CT is on vacation:
	- CMA project. Kunpeng is very involved in that. Taken more-or-less ownership.
	- CT involved in signing off on the science behind it.


NEXT STEPS re Cheryl:
- Set up a meeting with Weidong and Clinton week of 1/21.
